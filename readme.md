# Project _Pineapple_

Search Filter:
Created a form input with ng-model to filter the table data in realtime 

Pineapple Controller:
Created a new controller to pass the index of the headers for future functionalities like sort if necessary.

Sorting the rows with orderBy:this[0] (Models will be sorted ASC) since the rows in devices.json do not have key pairs.
